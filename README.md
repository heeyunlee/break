**This repository is archived. I started this repo when I was first learning mobile/flutter dev, and I've learned a lot since then. And well, there are way too many things to fix but a limited time.**

Break is a health & fitness tracking app built with Dart (Flutter) and Firebase. From logging nutritions to working out with YouTube videos, I have been learning and adding many cool features over the months, and here are some quick snippets.

## Introduction

### Why?
There are countless fitness apps available, yet I was never satisfied with just one app, and I always had to use multiple apps to log and track my physical activtivies—weightlifting and running—and nutrition consumption at the same time. For example, [Yazio] was very good for tracking nutritions consumptions, but tracking physical activities was never good there. [Strong] app was very good for tracking weight lifting exercises, but they didn't have the feautes to add nutritions consumptions. To achieve health & fitness goals such as dieting, both exercising AND eating are equally important, but no apps offered exceptionally good product for both.

That's why I started this project. The goal of this project is to create a all-in-one place for users to log and track their health & fitness. Users can log and track their body measurements, nutritions consumed, and workout data, and these data are transformed into customizable and easy-to-look dashboard, all in one app. 

This project is a work-in-process. I am keeping learning and developing new features. Below is the breif roadmap:

### Roadmap
#### Nutritions
- [x] Manaully add nutritions data
- [ ] Add nutritions by scanning bar code
- [ ] Automatically log nutritions data using credit card transactions data

#### Body Measurement
- [x] Manually add body measurements data
- [ ] Automatically sync measurements data with Apple HealthKit and/or Google Fit

#### Exercise
- [x] Log weight lifting exercise data manually
- [ ] Log other cardio workouts
- [x] Workout with YouTube Video

## Architecture
For this application, I've (sorted of) implemented the MVVM architecture pattern to increase maintainability and testability.
